# Scrollbound-Depths

Scrollbound Depths exists to challenge the notion that educational games must be bad. The aim with this game is to create an experience that plays the role of both education and gaming simultaneously and to do both well.

In Scrollbound Depths, you must traverse a board of tiles. Every tile you land on will reveal the contents it hid underneath. While extra things that could be hidden under the tiles is yet to be decided, for the minimum viable product, various trading cards will be hidden underneath. Each of these trading cards will represent a challenge that you, our hero (or thief) must persevere through. The challenge? Well, that’s where the educational content comes in.

Each trading card will quiz you on the custom educational content you chose for this adventure (later versions may include cards/events that do the teaching before the quizzing). If you answer correctly, you receive a reward of either health or food. If you answer incorrectly, you lose either food or health, and on top of that, the card then hides somewhere else in the level, now marked as a “hard challenge”. While not yet fully determined, hard challenges will likely have a different card design, sound design when revealed, and have different rewards and punishments (and this will likely be eventually customizable).

In the minimum viable product of the game, the game is won if you successfully find the treasure and navigate back to the beginning. However, the objectives can become much more varied as development continues.
