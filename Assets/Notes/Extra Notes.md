Idea: Use dice rolls to move instead of just each turn moving only one step. As a result, turns become much more interesting, with much more ability to avoid certain tiles and move, and much more ability to affect the dice via effects (ex: changing the numbers on the dice or other effects). This would also mean maps can be bigger and more immersive, and we can have the camera during gameplay be sufficiently zoomed in to give that sense of immersion.
